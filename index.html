                                <p>Dear My Love, My Sunshine, My Everything. Aqila Nur Izzati Hanisah</p> <p> Thanks for being my girlfriend, whenever you read this i really hope that ure still in my side tho. Im grateful, having such a wonderful girl in my side. It feels like having a house that is so fuckin comfy that whenever im outside i always missed my house vibes. Well according to that then Aqila is my house, YOU are my house, my most precious thing i had ever have in my own life. The first time i see you as a friend in GO was the time when i realize this girl was very out of my league. I mean you had that perspective too, but for me ure so precious and valuable, like youre the one that always gives me a good vibes, eventhough i cant gives all of that. Im sorry, because of my past i cant really do anything about myself. Its like im being programmed to do all the things by logic, determining humans value by their accomplishment and other stuff such as intellegence, grades, etc. But when i get to know you deeper i notice that YOURE DIFFERENT, youre not like what i have being teached since i was a child, youre not like what i thought everyone would be that makes me depressed all the time. And another ways to see my perspective is what ive become as a bf, you may have seen the amount of times i cried, overthinks, and much more. I was a such little young boy who never grows up and always cry just because of a simple things. </p> <p> Oh yeah, theres also a thing that i want to mention about u that makes me think youre such a wonderful person. Maybe ill use some good figure of speech (pls dont bully me if its bad) Alright, u know how i exactly draw urself in my imagination? (without all the dirty stuff ofc). I always imagine urself like a roses in the sunflower field. Sunflower always follows the sun when they're young, happy but limited to just following their fate. They never really done something by their own, and ends up hopeless. When i saw roses, i saw some self-master. Roses lives with emotion and freedom, they never really have its own specific habitat but they live accross the whole world. Roses was something that we called "special" because of its unique adaptability. Whenever i see you, i see roses. You live by your own perspective, you didnt rely on publics but trusting your own establishment. You also thinks of your future frequently, tries to improve everyday, oh my god what a wonderful person. </p> <p> No matter what mood you’re in, this space exists because you matter on good days and bad ones. Whenever youre reading this, just wanted u to know that i love you so much. i love you more than everything in this world, i love you that even i prayed for all of ur days in my prayers (which is funny because we had a different religion hehe) thank you for being my gf, idk what to say. </p> <p> I’m proud of you. Always. </p> <p style="margin-top:12px;">— Matthew 💙</p>
